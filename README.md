Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University has been publishing significant research works on IT field on its journal namely JU journal of Information technology since 2012. I wanted to create an online journal management system for this existing journal adhering to creative commons license and set up using open journal system developed by public knowledge project.

Here, information is guaranteed to be open for all enthusiasts, as non-members can also view and read current and previous issues published. Workflows are distributed in this system among different users with different roles to ensure more productivity and overwhelming managerial and clerical tasks that tend to question efficiency are supposed to be manageable, user friendly and efficient in this system. We hope that our system will serve many researchers and enthusiasts to find an appropriate platform to connect with.

Detailed video of the workflow and the project itself: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/158OL8YCAcRjuijHB1lVi_iAtrwWfcKaP

Workflow:
    • For browsing, anyone can go to the URL and check current and previous issues.
    • To make submissions, author has to create an account first by providing required information and agreeing to our privacy statement.
    • Author can request for a new submission as well as view the current state of previous submissions.
    • After submission, admin has to assign an editor.
    • Editor can send the submission to the reviewers, can directly send the submission to copyeditors avoiding review part or can decline submission.
    • At review phase, a reviewer is requested to submit review within a due date by the editor.
    • Reviewer can accept or decline the request. In the later case, editor has to look for another reviewer. 
    • After accepting review request, reviewer submits his recommendation and review file and let editor and author know about his feedback.
    • Editor decides the final recommendation, whether revision is required or not, and then sends that to author (if revision is required) or copyeditor (if no revision is required) or decline the submission.
    • Author provides necessary revisions if required. After necessary requirements are met, editor sends the file to copyediting.
    • In copyediting phase, further modifications are made if necessary, upon discussing with editor. Then it is sent to Production.
    • Production editor rechecks every data and metadata, adds required galleys, assigns for a particular issue and schedules the publication and notifies the author.
    • When the issue is published, the article will be visible along with it.
