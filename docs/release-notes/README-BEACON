This software will optionally provide PKP with a unique identifier for the
installation and the OAI base URL. These are to be used for statistics and
security alert purposes only.

This feature is optional. If you do not wish to participate, you may either
uncheck the "beacon" option in the installation form, or for existing installs,
edit your config.inc.php configuration file and set "enable_beacon" to Off.
