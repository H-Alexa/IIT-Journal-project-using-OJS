# Unsupported Upgrades

OJS 3.x does not support direct upgrades from all prior versions. If your copy
is extremely old, you may need to upgrade first to an intermediate version.

## Upgrading from OJS 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, or 2.3.x

In order to upgrade from these older branches of OJS, you will first need to
upgrade to an intermediate version of OJS 2.4.x. Download the latest copy of
OJS 2.4.x and follow the upgrade instructions included there, then read the
[docs/UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md) document included in this package to continue the
upgrade from there.

## Upgrading from OJS 2.4.x

In order to upgrade from OJS 2.x to 3.3.x or newer, you will first need to
upgrade to an intermediate version of OJS between 3.0.0 and 3.2.x (with the
latest 3.2.x recommended). Download an intermediate version of OJS and follow
the upgrade instructions included there, then read the [docs/UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md)
document included in this package to continue with the upgrade from there.

## Upgrading from OJS 3.0 Alpha or 3.0 Beta

Upgrades from OJS 3.0 Alpha and OJS 3.0 Beta to OJS 3.0 are not officially
supported; neither release is intended for production use.
