# Editorial Workflow

The editorial workflow allows you to usher a submission from initial evaluation through peer review, copyediting, and production, where the item is prepared for publication.

Each section of the workflow provides you with the information, tools, and discussion tools that you will need to complete the tasks for that stage. When your ready, you'll be presented with [editorial actions](editorial-workflow#editorial-actions) you can take that are appropriate to each stage. For more information, see [Learning OJS 3: Editorial Workflow](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow).
