# User Profile

This chapter covers user profiles, including registration, logging in, and making changes.

Once logged in, you can configure your User Profile and notification settings. To view your profile, find the link which displays your username at the top-right of the site when logged in.

You can update your name, contact details and password, as well as manage your public profile and configure what kind of notifications you'd like to receive.

If you're enrolled as a **Reviewer** for this site, you can enter your Reviewing Interests from the Roles tab.
