2. [Publishing the Submission](production#publish)

During the Production stage, the editor assigns production assistants who will help prepare the final publication files, known as galleys. For more detailed information, see [Learning OJS 3: Production](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow#production).

The Production stage provides two panels to create files ready for publication.

### <a name="production-ready"></a>Production Ready Files

All files selected by the editor for production will appear here. These typically include files that have been prepared during the [Copyediting stage](copyediting). Production assistants will use these files to generate the final publication formats.

### <a name="production-discussions"></a>Production Discussions

Editors and production assistants can use this panel to initiate conversations if there are any details that need to be clarified before the final publication files can be created.

### <a name="participants"></a>Participants

Editors can add production assistants or layout editors from this panel. [Learn more](../editorial-workflow#participants).

# <a name="publish"></a>Publishing the Submission

Editors and production assistants can create galley files for publication. These typically represent separate publication formats, such as PDF and HTML.

Once the production-ready files have been transformed into a galley file ready for publication, Editors can move from the Workflow panel to the Publication tab by using the Schedule for Publication button. The galley file will then be uploaded in the Publication tab.
