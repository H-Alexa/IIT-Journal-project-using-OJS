# Publication

From the Publication Tab, Editors can review and edit the metadata, upload the galley copy, set or make changes to the permissions, and assign the article to an issue.

## Create New Version

Creating a new version opens a new set of fields for the article metadata and galley files that is an exact copy of the published content.

You can edit and publish the updated content without changing the existing published content. All versions will be retained and are accessible in the public view of the article and from this Publication tab.

## Unpublish Article

Unpublishing the article will remove it from its scheduled issue and the public view.
