In Journal Settings you can configure information about the journal, including editorial team, contacts, sections, and categories for published content. See [Learning OJS 3: Journal Settings](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/journal-setup) for detailed instructions.

## <a name="masthead"></a>Masthead
Under Masthead enter information about your journal. Some of the information will automatically be displayed on pages of your journal's website.

## <a name="contact"></a>Contact
What you fill in for Contact tells users how to contact your journal. The Principal Contact is the automatic sender and receiver for some automated emails.

## <a name="sections"></a>Sections
You can add new sections or edit the sections listed here. Authors will be asked to select a section when they make a submission, and the articles you publish can be organized into sections.

## <a name="categories"></a>Categories
Categories offer another way to organize and provide access to your content by theme or category. You can create and edit categories here, display them as pages on your website, and add articles to them by editing the articles' metadata.
