In Distribution Settings you can configure how users access, discover, and use your journal content. See [Learning OJS 3: Distribution Settings](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-distribution) for detailed instructions.

## <a name="license"></a>License
Here you can configure copyright and permissions on a journal level. You will also be able to enter copyright and permissions information on an article and issue level when you publish articles and issues.

The **copyright** identifies the author or owner of copyright for a published work. For example, Copyright (c) 2016 by Jane Smith.

The **license** attached to a work will determine the usage rights for the published work. For example, CC-By 4.0 allows the work to be copied, redistributed, and adapted for any purpose, even commercially, as long as attribution is given to the copyright holder.

## <a name="indexing"></a>Search Indexing
Information here helps search engines and open indexes discover your content.

## <a name="payments"></a>Payments
Enable payments and select a payment method and currency if you are using subscriptions or author payment charges in your journal.

## <a name="access"></a>Access
If your journal is open access you can leave the default settings here. If you require subscriptions to some or all of your content or you publish your content on another website separate from OJS you can change the settings.

We encourage you to leave OAI enabled unless you are not using OJS to publish your content or otherwise do not want your metadata discoverable through the OAI protocol.

## <a name="archiving"></a>Archiving
If you have an agreement with a LOCKSS network to archive your journal content, you can enable it here to make your content available to the network.
