Same requirements as the OJS 3.0 core.

Note
---------
In order to register DOIs with DataCite from within OJS you will have to enter your username and password. 
If you do not enter or have your own username and password you'll still be able to export into the 
DataCite XML format but you cannot register your DOIs from within OJS.
Please note, that the passowrd will be saved as plain text, i.e. not encrypted, due to DataCite registration service requirements.
