msgstr "The default regex used can parse apache access log files in combined format and also the plugin's log files. If your access log files are in a different format you will have to insert a regex capable of parsing them and giving the expected values.

msgid "plugins.generic.usageStats.settings.dataPrivacyOption.requirements"
msgstr "To ensure data privacy, you must specify a file readable and writable by the web user to contain a randomly generated salt value.  This file must NOT be backed up to ensure privacy protection. The salt is randomly generated either using: the function mcrypt_create_iv, which requires the PHP mcrypt; the function openssl_random_pseudo_bytes, which requires the PHP openssl; the file /dev/urandom, which works only on *nix systems; or the function mt_rand, which is not cryptographically safe. Thus, if you are using a Windows server, please ensure that you install either the PHP mcrypt or openssl enabled in order to have the cryptographically safe generated salt."
