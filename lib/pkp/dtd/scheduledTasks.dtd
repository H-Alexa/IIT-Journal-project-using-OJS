  * task - a single task to execute

	  * The frequency settings take similar values as used in
	  * crontab entries
	  * E.g., "1", "2-3", "2-3,5,6", "*/2", "1-6/3", "*", etc.
	  * ("*" is assumed for any values that are omitted)
	  *
	  * The primary difference with crontab entries is that the task
	  * may not be executed at the exact specified time. E.g., if a
	  * task is set to execute at minute 0 of every hour, it will be
	  * executed if it has been more than one hour since the task
	  * was last run, regardless of the minute at the time the
	  * script is actually executed.
	  *
	  * minute: 0-59
	  * hour: 0-23
	  * day: 1-31
	  * month: 1-12
	  * dayofweek: 0-6 (Sunday-Saturday)
